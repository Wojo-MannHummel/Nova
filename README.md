# System Documentation Repository

This repository serves as a centralized version control system for our project's documentation. It is designed to store and track changes to documentation files by leveraging GitHub's features, we aim to simplify the process of updating and maintaining these documents.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need a GitHub account. If you don't have one, you can create it for free at [GitHub](https://github.com/). Once you have an account, navigate to the repository URL ([Link](https://github.com/Wojo-MannHummel/nova-docs)).

### Viewing Documents

You can browse the repository's contents directly from the web browser. Simply click on the directory or file you wish to view (note not all file types can be rendered). Because of this an automated workflow is implemented to take any .docx, .xlsx, .pptx files and convert to PDF to view in the browser located in the pdfs folder.

### Making Changes to Documents

To update a document, you will need to upload a new version of the file. Here's how you can do it using the GitHub web interface:

1. **Navigate to the Folder**: Go to the folder where the document you wish to update is located.

2. **Upload the New Version**: Click on the "Add file" button near the top right corner and select "Upload files" from the dropdown menu.

3. **Select Your File**: Simply drag and drop the file to be updated into the drop zone, alternativlely click "choose your files" to select the updated file from your computer. Ensure the file name matches the document you're updating else it will create a new file.

4. **Commit the Change**: After uploading the file, scroll down to the "Commit changes" section. Here, you can:
    - Provide a brief description of the changes made in the "Commit changes" textbox.
    - Choose to commit directly to the main branch or create a new branch and start a pull request. Committing directly to the main branch is straightforward, but starting a pull request allows for discussion and review before the changes go live.

5. **Submit Your Changes**: Click on "Commit changes" to finalize the update. The repository will now contain the latest version of your document, and the previous versions will be accessible through the commit history, allowing for version control and rollback if necessary.


### Best Practices

- **Small, Frequent Updates**: It's easier to track and understand small changes than large, infrequent updates.
- **Descriptive Commit Messages**: Clearly describe what changed and why. This helps the team follow the repository's history and understand each change's purpose.
- **Review Before Committing**: Always preview your changes and proofread your work to ensure accuracy and clarity.
